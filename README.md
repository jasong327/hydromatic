# hydromatic
Systematically reusable Lightning components to copy and/or learn from

This project contains a set of components built using the Salesforce Lightning Component framework.

It also contains a test drive application that allows you to quickly play with each component to try: 
  - how it feels as a user
  - how it works in a responsive desktop/mobile application
  - how it was assembled
  
Our hope this that this collection of parts will provide an asset that is automatically valuable to the 
community of Salesforce developers that are learning and building custom Salesforce applications.

The initial components in this project will be assembled to migrate 
[the Graphvizforce project](http://stevebuik.github.io/GraphVizForce) to the Lightning framework.
